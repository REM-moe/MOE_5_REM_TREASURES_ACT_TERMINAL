"Haa, its Darren!", Chuck exclaimed. "His own blood. Now we have enough evidence to concrete our suspicion."

"Teddy, let’s call Bureau and also, inform local police. He should not escape."

My mind still was in dilemma, Darren lives in Huston which is miles away, and he has no crime records. The tension between Darren and Caesar has been there for at least a few decades and why would he kill his own blood for such petty family issues.

"Wait Chuck, don’t hurry. I have a feeling, we have more to uncover."

His half-opened desk drawer suddenly caught my eye. I proceeded to open it and the drawer revealed an old diary. I quickly opened hopping for clues but the diary was suspiciously empty. The only writing in it was on the last page. 
We read it together. All of a sudden chuck exclaimed,

"Teddy! It’s an algorithm."

"Algorithm for what?", I asked out of confusion.
With a smug face, Chuck replied, "We have a diary to read."

Clue 2: Caesar's Diary

Task: 
	> Write a program using the algorithm.
	> Read Caecar's actual diary.
	> Combine both clues to find the actual killer.

PS:
	> diary.txt holds the algorithm found in the old diary.   
	> next.zip holds the link to next part. It opens with the Killer's surname.
